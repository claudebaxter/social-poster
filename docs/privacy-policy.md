## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only
- **All user data is stored locally** on your device using encrypted Electron Store
- **No cloud storage**: We do not store any user data on remote servers or databases
- **No data transmission**: Your credentials and content remain on your device except when posting to social platforms

### Security Measures

- **No data brokers**: We do not work with data brokers or advertising networks
- **No tracking**: We do not track user behavior across websites or applications

### Limited Disclosure
We may only disclose information if required by law or to protect our legal rights, but given our local-storage-only approach, we typically have no data to disclose.

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Control
- **View Data**: You can view all stored data through the application settings

## Third-Party Services

### Social Media Platforms

### OAuth Authentication
We use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication, which means:

## Children's Privacy

Social Poster is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such information.

## International Data Transfers

Since all data is stored locally on your device, there are no international data transfers. When you post content to social media platforms, that data transfer is handled directly by those platforms according to their privacy policies.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. We will notify users of any material changes by:
- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting notifications in the application
- Publishing updates on our GitHub repository

## Data Retention

### Local Data
- **User Control**: You control all data retention through local storage management
- **Automatic Cleanup**: OAuth tokens expire according to platform policies
- **Manual Deletion**: You can delete all data by disconnecting accounts or uninstalling

### No Server Data
Since we don't store data on servers, we have no server-side data retention policies.
